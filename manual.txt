Manual: Running the JOJ Game server and web client
===============================================

Server setup and launch
-----------------------
1) Ensure Python 3.11+ is available. From the repository root, enter the server folder and create a virtual environment:
   cd server
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
2) Install backend dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3) (Optional) Configure environment values such as allowed OAuth providers by creating a .env file:
   echo "ALLOWED_OAUTH_PROVIDERS=apple,google,guest" >> .env
4) Start the FastAPI server in development mode. The API allows requests from the locally served web client (http://localhost:8001) and admin console (http://localhost:8002):
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Web client setup and launch
---------------------------
1) In another shell, serve the static web client from the client-web directory (no build step is required):
   cd client-web
   python -m http.server 8001
   The API server allows cross-origin calls from http://localhost:8001 and http://127.0.0.1:8001 by default.
2) Serve the admin console from the client-web directory on a separate port:
   cd ../client-web
   python -m http.server 8002
   The API server also allows cross-origin calls from http://localhost:8002 and http://127.0.0.1:8002 by default.
3) Open http://localhost:8001/ for the player client and http://localhost:8002/ for admin tools. In the UIs, set the API base URL to the FastAPI server address (defaults to http://localhost:8000). If you change the client or admin ports, update the API server's allowed origins accordingly.
